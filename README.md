Headache
The project environment
OBJ
•	BAU and project work

•	Proj lifecylcle and models

•	Business roles

•	Risks

•	Project knowledge

Project vs BAU
BAU is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation

 A project is unique and transient with desired outcome

Defined start, middle and end
BAU
Optimise tasks
Project

The triple constraint
Find the scope of the project although being bound by:
•	Time

•	Quality

•	cost.
POPIT Model
•	P – people
•	O – Organisation
•	P – Process
•	T – Technology

The holistic triangle

Benefit of a well-managed project


Project lifecycle

Intiation => planning => execution = > monitoring and controlling

Software development lifecycle

Waterfall
•	System requirements

•	Software requirements

•	Analysis

•	Program design

•	Coding

•	Testing

•	Ops

You can’t go back

v-model
same as waterfall but instead of testing as one stage, test after every stage
•	Acceptance testing

•	System test

•	Integration test

•	Unit test

Agile
Iterative
Plan=>Do=>Check

Some Agile methodologies
TDD

Scrum

Lean

KANBAN

Working in Agile teams
Many silos – not what you want

You want one team from different places.

Attributes of mature teams
•	Co-Located – located together

•	Cross functional roles

•	Self-organising

•	Accountable and empowered

•	Test and learn feedback loops

Business cases
Argument framed for a business

•	Expected benefits

•	Execution timeline

•	Executive summary

•	Investment appraisal

•	Solutions/options

•	Major risks

•	Stakeholders/ communication plan

A justification for the proposed project needed to obtain authorisation from the board










Strategy analysis

•	MOST

•	Boston Box

•	Porters five forces

•	PESTLE – Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal and Environmental

•	SWOT – Strength - Weeknesses - opportunities - training

Stakeholder Analysis

•	Workshops

•	Interviews

•	Questionnaires

Return On Investments (ROI)

Ratio for how much you get for every pound invested

Allows you to understand what investment makes sense.
Risk
Exposure to danger or adverse situations

Identifying risks allows for better planning and minimise those said risks.

What impact the risks could have.

Identifying risks
•	Brainstorming

•	Prompt list

•	Delphi

•	SWOT

•	Previous experience


Some source of risk
•	Technology

•	Team

•	Scope

•	Business

•	Economy

•	Competition

Dealing with risks
•	Avoidance

•	Transfer

•	Reduce

•	Accept

•	Exploit

•	Share

•	Enhance

•	Ignore















Stakeholder
•	Partners

•	Suppliers

•	Regulator

•	Employee

•	Managers

•	Owners

•	Competitors

•	Customers
Anyone who has a stake on the business.

Interest
Changes over time – dynamic.













Stakeholder Attitudes
•	Champions – Actively fight your cause

•	Supporter – Will help

•	Neutral

•	Critic – Have something against you

•	Opponents – actively offer obstacles

•	Blocker – Stops you

































Planning
•	Project plan

•	Resource plan

•	Financial plan

•	Quality plan

•	Acceptance plan

•	Communication plan

Project scope
Total sum of all the work for the project to be completed – defined through time resources and costs.

Well thought out plan
1.	Task breakdown

2.	Estimation of durations

3.	Understand logical dependencies

4.	Create network diagram

5.	Grant chart

Task breakdown
Breakdown the project into different stages

Estimation
10 can be done in multiple iterations and 1 meaning that the task can be done easily

Logical dependencies
Some tasks may need to be done before another task.

Each task has a dependency so we can start mapping it out on a table
This creates a visual reference of activities that must finish before another can start
Network diagram

NetworkDiagram



CRITICAL PATH
the longest path that will effect the deadline if delayed.


Earliest start
Latest start
Float
Duration
Task

Each of these help you calculate the duration of your project and also the amount of time tasks are able to slop within that project

Early start = prev early start + duration

Calculating latest start

Latest start = duration – latest start

Perspective
Don’t write flexibility and
